<p>If you are a college student, chances are you may know of someone who uses <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/?s=Adderall">Adderall</a> to power through their studies. </p>
<p>And that&rsquo;s the word for it: <em>power.</em></p>
<p>For Adderall in and of itself is an extremely potent amphetamine-based medication, which helps people focus on their tasks. And because college life is filled with tasks, it is understandable why Adderall has such a famous following.</p>
<p>But what if you run into that same <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/substance-abuse-studies">college student</a> two or so years after they graduate, and they admit to you they&rsquo;re still on Adderall? Why? Because it helps them focus on their job. This is what can be referred to as an Adderall Pro. </p>
<p>In short, an Adderall pro is someone who has been on the drug since a very young age, and now has carried the drug with them into their adult lives.</p>

        <h2><strong>ADDERALL PRO – THE HISTORY</strong></h2>
<p>In traditional settings, such as a doctor&rsquo;s office or hospital, Adderall is prescribed to those with ADHD or narcolepsy.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s the drug&rsquo;s ability to get a person to focus that has made Adderall so popular. Adderall even has its own moniker on some campuses, where students refer to it as the &ldquo;study drug.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is to be used as long as the patient has focus issues, which for some can exist their entire lives.</p>
<p>So consequentially, the patient who is on Adderall as a young person, stays on it through adulthood with little to no hope of getting off the drug, particularly as Adderall is now engrained in their current career, helping them to concentrate on their work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><strong>STRIKES THAT GO AGAINST ADDERALL</strong></h2>
<p>Of course, as is the case with most any amphetamine-based drug, Adderall is highly addictive.</p>
<p>In fact, many who have been prescribed the drug from when they were children to young adults, who still use Adderall, may not even know that they&rsquo;re currently addicted to the drug, and that it&rsquo;s now a part of their adult lifestyle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As to those who want to kick the Adderall habit, ridding one&rsquo;s self of the drug is a complicated and at times, dangerous endeavor. It is not recommended that a person who has a substance abuse issue with Adderall to attempt detox and rehabilitation on their own.</p>
<p>Those in the medical community, as well as the rehabilitation community, insist that anyone who feels a need to rid themselves of their Adderall habit, enter rehab.  There, they can safely detox and recover with proper medical attention.</p>
<h2><strong>SO WHY IS THE WORD &ldquo;PRO&rdquo; SO SIGNIFICANT WITH ADDERALL USE?</strong></h2>
<p>Adderall, more or less, is a professional&rsquo;s drug. With its ability to increase a person&rsquo;s focus, Adderall has become one of those rare drugs that employers gloss over during drug testing.</p>
<p>So, you can get busted by <a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/?s=drug+testing">failing a drug test</a> for marijuana, but Adderall, even with its relationship to amphetamines, is still accepted in certain work places, even after a person fails a drug test due to Adderall.</p>
<p>This is especially true if the employer knows the benefits of Adderall, and outweighs job performance of his/her addicted personnel to their quality of life.</p>
<h2><strong>BECOME AN ADDERALL EX-PRO</strong></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.blvdcenters.org/blog/doctors-addiction-training">Addiction&rsquo;s no fun</a>, particularly if you&rsquo;re addicted to a drug that was once prescribed to help you. </p>
<p>Even if your addiction improves your work performance, garnering kudos from your boss, the fact with addiction – any type of addiction – is one day, it will need to be addressed. </p>
<p>If you do choose to be an ex-pro Adderall user who wants to no longer have the drug as part of your life-work balance, consult a legitimate healthcare provider whose specialty is rehabilitation from drugs such as this.</p>
